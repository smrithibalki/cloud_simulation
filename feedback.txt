Homework 1

The maximum grade for this homework is 8%. Points are subtracted from this maximum grade: for example, saying
that 2% is lost if some requirement is not completed means that the resulting grade will be 8%-2% => 6%;
if the core homework functionality does not work or it is not implemented as specified in your documentation,
 your grade will be zero;

Grading Criteria:
 - only some basic cloud simulation examples from the cloudsim repo are given and nothing else is done:
    * 
 - having less than five unit and/or integration scalatests:
    * 5+ unit tests: -0%
 - missing comments and explanations from the simulation program:
    * comments present, but not that descripitive: -0.1%
 - logging is not used in the simulation programs:
    * logging used: -0%
 - hardcoding the input values in the source code instead of using the suggested configuration libraries:
    * configuration used: -0%
 - for each used var for heap-based shared variables or mutable collections:
    * no vars: -0%
 - for each used while or for or other loops with induction variables to iterate over a collection:
    * no loops: -0%
 - no instructions in README.md on how to install and run your simulator:
    * instructions present, but no command line: -0.5%
 - the program crashes without completing the core functionality:
    * program runs: -0%
 - the documentation exists but it is insufficient to understand your cloud simulation design and models and how you assembled and deployed all components of the cloud:
    * documentation exists: -0%
Total grade: 7.4%
